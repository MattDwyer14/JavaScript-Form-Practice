Calorie Counter
A simple web-based calorie counter that helps you track your daily calorie intake and exercise to manage your calorie budget effectively. I created this as part of the Javascript course created by CodeCademy. The intent is to practice for creation with js.

Features:
- Calorie Budget: Set your daily calorie budget.
- Meal Tracking: Add multiple entries for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
- Exercise Tracking: Log exercises to account for calories burned.
- Calorie Calculation: Calculate your remaining calories to see if you're in a surplus or deficit.
- Clear Entries: Reset all inputs to start fresh.

Usage:
- Launch index.html in your web browser.

Set Calorie Budget:
- Enter your daily calorie budget in the "Budget" field at the top of the form.

Add Entries:
- Use the dropdown menu labeled "Add food or exercise" to select a category: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, or Exercise.
- Click the "Add Entry" button to add a new entry to the selected category.

For each entry:
- Enter the name (optional) in the "Name" field.
- Enter the number of calories:
- For food items, input the calorie content as a positive number.
- For exercises, input the calories burned as a positive number.

Calculate Remaining Calories:
- After adding all your entries, click the "Calculate Remaining Calories" button.

The app will display:
- Your calorie surplus or deficit.
- Total calories budgeted.
- Total calories consumed.
- Total calories burned through exercise.

Clear Entries:
- To reset all fields and start over, click the "Clear" button.

Notes:
- Ensure all calorie inputs are positive numbers.
- The app will alert you if any invalid inputs are detected.
- Calories burned through exercise are added back to your remaining calorie budget.
